1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13H0u0kyCocOa8+RZeyjqttorDB
Your Rationale: I went with a dark blue color for the new console gaming system.
As it is monochromatic, I figured the different shades, tints, and tones would
fit that theme. I see a lot of tech-related companies use blue for their coloring
like HP. Playstation as a gaming console has their logo as blue so I associate
blue with gaming.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52q0u0kPkK-eEmQeEmQeEmQgwYW
Your Rationale: I chose hues of light green, yellow, and a darker green for the
springtime tours announcement at the Chicago Botanical Gardens. My reasoning for
this is due to the fact that green is always associated with nature and new
beginnings (Spring). I went with a higher saturation to make the green be more
lively. The different shades and tones added in from the original base colors
would be able to be used as the text colors.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31P0A0kCU++Gwn3Gwn3Gwn3hOOj
Your Rationale: This color palette has a variety of bright colors like yellow,
pink, and blue. The saturation has been set higher for the brightness and vitality
of the colors. A lot of products and platforms created for children are very
colorful and fun so this palette reflects just that. 

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity
