## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://checklist.com/website-usability-checklist/
2. https://html.com/blog/website-testing-usability-checklist/

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Ensure that the site works on all web browsers
2. The font is easy to read and not everything is styled
3. Have reasonable number of buttons or links that user has to click
4. Visitors should know what the purpose of the site is (in our case, what we
  sell)
5. Have a clear and easy to use navigation
6. Don't place too much content on one page or cluster everything together to avoid overloading the user
7. Make sure the links in the site work
8. Have visible and explicit prices on items
9. Keep the design of the webpage consistent
10. The site should work in different viewports so users with differently sized devices can access the content all the same.
