## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines    (point to the specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/custom-icons/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
In this first sketch, I utilized Apple's Custom Icons design guidelines. Rather
than having a measly, hard to press "View Cart" link, I changed it to the shopping
cart icon that everyone is familiar with. With this, the cart icon is also filled
in to improve legibility as opposed to using just a cart outline. Additionally,
I replaced MCA's navigation bar with a disappearing hamburger menu on the upper-
left hand side beneath "MCA." I added icons relating to their functionalities
next to the text. As means of improving personalization, at the top of the menu
has text that says "Welcome (name here)" along with a person icon. So anyone
who logs into their account gets a little extra feature. As I was redoing the
menu, I noticed that the "Tickets" and "Admissions" link basically took you to
the same thing, so I removed "Admissions" as that was unnecessary and redundant.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/pickers/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
For the second sketch, I fixed MCA's picker and added controls of my own to
reduce clutter. The original list was long and tedious so I created 4 separate
types of memberships and then added their own subgroups. Before, going into the
first text input field, it required you to scroll through a long list of all
their memberships with details. I saw that these four memberships were repeated
quite often: Basic Membership, Premier Membership, Circle Membership, and DVC
Membership. I changed the list for the picker to only contain those four options.
As for the subcategories within the chosen memberships, I added radio buttons at
the bottom to include options for the user to choose. The text would also be part
of the selection field to increase touchability. For example, in my sketch, I
picked "Premier Membership." After choosing a membership, it will auto-populate
radio buttons with the corresponding types like "Friend," "Contributor", "Associate,"
and "Advocate."

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/text-fields/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
As for my last sketch, I focused on the text fields design guideline--primarily
the keyboard type. On the MCA site, when you click on the text field where you
put a monetary value, the entire QWERTY keyboard comes up. However, that is a
bit unneeded because you're only going to be entering digit values. In my sketch,
I replaced it with a phone keyboard in order to streamline data entries.
