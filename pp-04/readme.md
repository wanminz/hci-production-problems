## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines    (point to the specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/custom-icons/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
In this first sketch, I utilized Apple's Custom Icons design guidelines. Rather
than having a measly, hard to press "View Cart" link, I changed it to the shopping
cart icon that everyone is familiar with. With this, the cart icon is also filled
in to improve legibility as opposed to using just a cart outline. Additionally,
I replaced MCA's navigation bar with a disappearing hamburger menu on the upper-
left hand side beneath "MCA." I added icons relating to their functionalities
next to the text. As means of improving personalization, at the top of the menu
has text that says "Welcome (name here)" along with a person icon. So anyone
who logs into their account gets a little extra feature. As I was redoing the
menu, I noticed that the "Tickets" and "Admissions" link basically took you to
the same thing, so I removed "Admissions" as that was unnecessary and redundant.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/pickers/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/text-fields/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
